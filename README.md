## How to Use
1. Clone the project
2. Install Unity Editor v2022.3.26f1
3. Open the cloned project in the Unity Editor

## Objective
The objective of this research is to find out what the effect of dynamically transparent ghost instructors is on 
learning and retaining skills in virtual reality environments.
Dynamically transparent ghost instructors, in the context of this study, are essentially first-person perspective ghost 
metaphor-based instructors whose transparency changes depending on how well the student is learning the taught skill.
