### Human and Ghost Avatars
The human and ghost avatars were made using the `MakeHuman` plugin (version `mpfb2-20240602`) for Blender. 
The output of this plugin is regarded as the result of the assets used and the creator's input and is thus covered by the licenses that cover the used assets.

The assets used for the two avatars that have been created for this project are all available under a `CC0 1.0 Universal` license and are:
1. The `MAKEHUMAN_SYSTEM_ASSETS` package available at: https://static.makehumancommunity.org/assets/assetpacks/makehuman_system_assets.html.
2. The `SYSTEM_HAIR_MATERIALS01` package available at: https://static.makehumancommunity.org/assets/assetpacks/system_hair_materials01.html.
3. The `SHIRTS01` package available at: https://static.makehumancommunity.org/assets/assetpacks/shirts01.html.
4. The `PANTS01` package available at: https://static.makehumancommunity.org/assets/assetpacks/pants01.html.

The full license text of the `CC0 1.0 Universal` license can be found in [Avatar License File](LICENSE.AVATARS.md).
